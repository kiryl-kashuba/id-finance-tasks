Just read docs, watch video and ask for questions:

* https://projectreactor.io/docs
* https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference
* https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core
* https://www.luxoft-training.ru/about/news/Reaktivnoe_programmirovanie_na_Java_kak_zachem_i_stoit_li_1
* https://www.luxoft-training.ru/about/news/Reaktivnoe_programmirovanie_na_Java_kak_zachem_i_stoit_li_2
//I have deleted information that potentially falls under "trade secrets"//

Then practice online in Reactor:
